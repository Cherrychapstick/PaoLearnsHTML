          One day, Timothy the Kitten meowed at a certain bird with orange feathers. The bird sat in the nearest branch
          to observe the curious movements of the feline. The bird was very intregued. He stopped by everyday at around
          the same time to say hello to Timothy the Kitten who would surely be enjoying the morning sun on the other side of the winow sill.
